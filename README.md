The Adafruit's Data Logging Shield for Arduino saves data to files on any FAT16- or FAT32-formatted SD card 
in a way that can be read later by most plotting, spreadsheet, or analysis programs.

The Real Time Clock (RTC) chip timestamps all the data with the current TIME, so that one may know precisely what happened.

The goal in this project is to save the data on a SD card when sending from the sender to the receiver. The original code has been modified 
to manage this purpose.
